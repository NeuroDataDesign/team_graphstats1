**GraSpy: Graph Statistics in Python**
Authors: Jaewon Chung , Benjamin D. Pedigo, Eric W. Bridgeford, Bijan K.Varjavand, Hayden S. Helm, and Joshua T. Vogelstein

**Introduction**
- Graspy provides implementations of algorithms such as graph and multigraph embedding methods, two-graph hypothesis testing, and clustering of vertices of graphs (works on weighted or unweighted)
 - Does statistical modeling of populations of networks and utilizes Networkx for essential graph algorithms

**Personal Notes**
- Overview of the modules, but the online tutorial has more in-depth documentation
- Can be used with scikit-learn and numpy/network arrays
